# recruFlow

Local job-application automation system for the Polish job market. Runs entirely on a
developer's machine via Docker Compose, uses a local LLM (Ollama) for AI work, and automates
ingestion, scoring, tailoring, and sending of job applications. Single-user tool, no
multi-tenant concerns.

This repository is bootstrapping (Phase 0). This README will be extended as later stories add
Docker Compose, the database, the frontend, and CI.

## Getting started

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) first, then:

```bash
uv sync --all-groups   # install main, dev, and test dependency groups
uv run ruff check .    # lint
uv run mypy .          # type-check
uv run pytest          # run the test suite
```

Or via the Makefile:

```bash
make install
make lint
make typecheck
make test
```

## Frontend

The frontend is a React + Vite + TypeScript project under `frontend/`, managed with
[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install        # install dependencies (writes/reads pnpm-lock.yaml)
pnpm dev            # start the Vite dev server at http://localhost:5173
pnpm lint           # ESLint
pnpm format         # Prettier — write mode
pnpm format:check   # Prettier — check mode, no writes
```

TypeScript strict mode is enabled (`tsconfig.app.json` / `tsconfig.node.json`), and styling is
done exclusively with Tailwind CSS utility classes.
