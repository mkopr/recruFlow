### Dependency groups (`pyproject.toml`)

- `main` — runtime dependencies of the FastAPI application: `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, the async
  SQLAlchemy stack (`sqlalchemy[asyncio]`, `asyncpg`), `alembic`, `pydantic`,
  `pydantic-settings`. Later phases add further runtime deps here incrementally
  (`langchain`/`langgraph`/`langchain-ollama` in P3US2, `playwright` in P5US6,
  `weasyprint`/`python-docx` in P4US4/P6US4) as the story that needs them lands.
- `dev` — local developer tooling: `ruff`, `mypy`, `pre-commit`.
- `test` — test-only dependencies: `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, `httpx`, `pytest-cov`.

### `app/` package

Exposes `__version__` (P0US1) plus, as of P0US4, `app/main.py`: a minimal FastAPI app with a
single `GET /health` route returning `{"status": "ok"}`. This exists only so the `api` Compose
service has a real HTTP endpoint to health-check — it does not load settings, open a DB session,
or wire OpenAPI docs. P0US6 (FastAPI skeleton) replaces this stub with full Pydantic Settings
loading, the DB session dependency, and the rest of the application's routers.

### `app/db/` package (P0US5)

- `base.py` — a single `Base(DeclarativeBase)` that every ORM model and Alembic's
  `target_metadata` share, so migrations autogenerate off the same metadata the app queries
  against.
- `models.py` — the six v1 tables (see "Database schema" below).
- `session.py` — `get_database_url() -> str` (reads `DATABASE_URL`, raises `RuntimeError` if
  unset — fails loudly rather than silently defaulting to the wrong database),
  `get_engine() -> AsyncEngine`, `get_sessionmaker(engine: AsyncEngine | None = None) ->
  async_sessionmaker[AsyncSession]`. No FastAPI dependency lives here — P0US6 builds its `get_db`
  dependency directly on top of `get_sessionmaker()`, so this module is the single reusable
  entrypoint for both Alembic and the application.
- `seed.py` — `run_seed(session: AsyncSession) -> None`, used by `make seed`. Uses Postgres
  `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` keyed on each table's natural unique column (`sources.name`,
  `offers.dedup_hash`, `profiles.name`) so it is safe to re-run.

## Database schema (P0US5)

Alembic (async template) is wired to `app/db/base.py`'s `Base.metadata` via `alembic/env.py`,
which reads `DATABASE_URL` from the environment at runtime rather than from `alembic.ini` (kept
blank) — matching `.env.example`, one source of truth for the connection string. The v1 migration
creates all six tables spanning every phase's domain nouns up front, so no later phase needs a
repeated foundational migration:

| Table | Purpose | Key columns / constraints |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sources` | A job board connector (SOLID.Jobs, JustJoin.it, NoFluffJobs) | `name` unique; `config_json` (JSONB) per-source config |
| `offers` | A normalised job posting with exactly one Source | `dedup_hash` unique + indexed (dedup on canonical URL, P1US1 fallback to title+company+location); `raw_payload` (JSONB, ELT raw payload always populated at ingest) |
| `profiles` | Candidate's structured facts: skills, experience, preferences | `name` unique; `is_active` (only one row active at a time, enforced by application logic, not a DB constraint); `data` (JSONB) |
| `cv_versions` | Tailored CV + cover letter drafted for one Offer/Profile pair | FKs to `offers`/`profiles`; `status` string (no DB enum, so later statuses need no migration) |
| `match_scores` | Structured evaluation of one Offer against a Profile (grade A–F + dimensions) | FKs to `offers`/`profiles`; `engine` distinguishes LangChain vs. `sjctl` scoring |
| `applications` | Record of intent/action to apply | FKs to `offers`/`profiles`/`cv_versions`; `status` one of `drafted`/`reviewed`/`sent`/`failed`/`interview`/`offer`/`rejected` (unconstrained string, not a DB enum) |

`make migrate` runs `docker compose exec api alembic upgrade head` (mirrors the `sjctl-version`
pattern — `DATABASE_URL`'s `db` hostname only resolves inside the Compose network, not from the
host). `make seed` runs `docker compose exec api python -m app.db.seed`, loading three sample
offers and one active stub profile; both targets are idempotent.

### `frontend/` project

React + Vite + TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS, managed with `pnpm`.

- **TypeScript project references**: `tsconfig.json` is a references-only root (`files: []`)
  pointing at `tsconfig.app.json` (strict, browser `lib`, covers `src/`) and
  `tsconfig.node.json` (covers `vite.config.ts`, which runs in a Node context with different
  `lib`/`module` needs). This mirrors the official Vite React-TS template so editor tooling and
  build-time config type-check independently of app source.
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: wired via the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin in `vite.config.ts` — no
  `tailwind.config.js` or `postcss.config.js`; content scanning is automatic and Tailwind is
  enabled by a single `@import "tailwindcss";` in `src/index.css`.
- **ESLint flat config** (`eslint.config.js`): `@eslint/js` recommended +
  `typescript-eslint` recommended + `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` +
  `eslint-plugin-react-refresh`, with `eslint-config-prettier` applied last so no ESLint
  stylistic rule conflicts with Prettier. `dist` is excluded via `ignores` so a local
  `pnpm build` doesn't break `pnpm lint`.
- **Prettier** (`.prettierrc.json`): `printWidth: 100` to mirror the Python side's
  `ruff` line-length 100.
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` is committed, same reproducible-install precedent as `uv.lock`.

### Makefile targets

- `install` — `uv sync --all-groups` + `cd frontend && pnpm install`.
- `format` — `uv run ruff format .` + `cd frontend && pnpm format`.
- `lint` — `uv run ruff check .` + `uv run mypy .` + `cd frontend && pnpm lint`.
- `typecheck` — `uv run mypy .` + `cd frontend && pnpm run typecheck` (`tsc --noEmit`).
- `test` / `test-unit` / `test-integration` — `uv run pytest`, scoped by the `integration`
  marker. Python-only; no frontend test runner is in scope yet.
- `ci` — runs `format lint typecheck test` in sequence; now covers both stacks since `lint`,
  `format`, and `typecheck` each fan out to the frontend toolchain.
- `clean` — removes `__pycache__`, `.mypy_cache`, `.ruff_cache`, `.pytest_cache`, `dist`,
  `build`.
- `up` — `docker compose up --build`; brings up all four Compose services with hot reload for
  `api` and `frontend` (P0US4).
- `sjctl-version` — `docker compose exec api sjctl version`; prints the `sjctl` binary version
  installed inside the `api` container (P0US4).
- `migrate` — `docker compose exec api alembic upgrade head` (P0US5).
- `seed` — `docker compose exec api python -m app.db.seed` (P0US5).

`generate-types`, depending on infrastructure introduced by a later story, is deliberately out of
scope here and will be added by P0US7.

- `install` now also runs `uv run pre-commit install` after the dependency/frontend install
  steps, registering the git hooks defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

### Pre-commit hooks (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`)

Hook definitions live in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. Every hook except `trailing-whitespace`
(from the upstream `pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks` repo) is a `local` hook with
`language: system`, calling the same commands `make lint` / `make format` / `make typecheck`
already use (`uv run --frozen ruff check --fix`, `uv run --frozen ruff format`,
`pnpm exec eslint . --fix`, `uv run --frozen mypy .`) plus two lockfile-sync checks
(`uv lock --check`, `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`). Using the project's own
uv/pnpm-managed toolchain instead of hosted mirrors (e.g. `astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit`,
`mirrors-mypy`) means pre-commit and `make ci` can never disagree about tool versions.
`--frozen` is required on every `uv run` hook: by default `uv run` auto-syncs the environment
before running, which silently rewrites `uv.lock` to match `pyproject.toml` — that would mask
real drift before the `uv-lock-check` hook ever runs. `--frozen` runs against the lock file
as committed, so `uv-lock-check` is the sole source of truth on lock/pyproject sync. Hooks
are ordered so auto-fixers run before non-fixable checks, per the "auto fix before check"
requirement.

## Docker Compose services (P0US4)

`docker-compose.yml` defines four services, brought up together by `make up`. Service names,
ports, and credentials match `.env.example` exactly.

| Service | Image / build target | Port | Healthcheck |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `api` | `Dockerfile` target `runtime` | 8000 | `curl -f http://localhost:8000/health` |
| `frontend` | `Dockerfile.frontend` target `dev` | 5173 | `wget --spider http://localhost:5173` |
| `db` | `postgres:16-alpine` | 5432 | `pg_isready -U recruflow -d recruflow` |
| `ollama` | `ollama/ollama:latest` | 11434 | `ollama list` |

Notes:

- `api` and `frontend` bind-mount their source directories (`./app`, `./frontend`) so
  `uvicorn --reload` and the Vite dev server pick up local edits without a container rebuild.
  `frontend` also declares an anonymous volume on `/app/node_modules` so the host bind mount
  doesn't shadow the dependencies installed inside the image.
- `api` depends on `db` with `condition: service_healthy`, so it won't start accepting
  connections until Postgres is actually ready.
- `db` and `ollama` persist state in named volumes (`pgdata`, `ollama_data`) so data survives
  `docker compose down` (but not `docker compose down -v`).
- The `Dockerfile` multi-stage build installs `sjctl` (the SOLID.Jobs CLI) into the `runtime`
  stage via its official install script
  (`scripts/install-sjctl.sh` from `solid-company/solid-jobs-skills`), with cosign signature
  verification skipped (`SJCTL_SKIP_COSIGN=1`, since `cosign` isn't installed in this image) —
  the script still verifies the release asset's sha256 checksum. `make sjctl-version` runs
  `sjctl version` inside the running `api` container.
- `Dockerfile.frontend` has three stages: `dev` (Vite dev server, used by `docker-compose.yml`),
  `build` (`pnpm build`, produces `frontend/dist`), and `production` (nginx serving the built
  static assets via `frontend/nginx.conf`, an SPA fallback for client-side routing added in
  later phases). Only `dev` is wired into Compose today; `production` is built but not yet
  deployed anywhere.
